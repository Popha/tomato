        <p>Grasshopper Adventures offer bicycle tours across Asia, ranging from one day trips to cross-country multiple day adventures.</p>
        <p style=margin-bottom:50px;">The business had outgrown their existing website and Grasshopper needed a partner for a new website that would drive more bookings in a very competitive market. We developed a Neos website with a sophisticated filter system that provides a better user experience for customers and relieves internal resources.</p>
