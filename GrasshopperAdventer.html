        <p>Grasshopper Adventures offer bicycle tours across Asia, ranging from one day trips to cross-country multiple day adventures. </p>
        <p style="margin:bottom70px">The business had outgrown their existing website and Grasshopper needed a partner for a new website that would drive more bookings in a very competitive market. We developed a Neos website with a sophisticated filter system that provides a better user experience for customers and relieves internal resources.</p>

        <h1>The Challenge</h1>
        <p>
            <li>Satisfy specific "look and feel" requirements - clean, simple, elegant, logical, with a little less green</li>
            <li>Develop a website to equally serve two different customer groups - day trippers and multi-day adventurers</li>
            <li>Enhance the tour searching and booking process so that more tours are booked online</li>
            <li>Connect with the client's existing booking management platform (REDZY) where bookings and tour dates are managed</li>
            <li>Provide intuitive navigation on both desktop and mobile for travelers on the move</li>
            <li>Reduce the internal resources needed to manage the tours and bookings</li>
            <li>Assess and optimize Grasshopper's digital marketing strategies</li>
